## Project Setup Guide

### Overview

This README provides instructions for setting up and running the project scripts on both Windows and macOS systems. It includes steps to configure the environment and execute the main application.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your system (preferably the latest LTS version).
- Administrative privileges may be required for installation on both platforms.

### Setup Instructions

#### For Windows Users

1. **Open Command Prompt**:
   - Navigate to the directory where the `.bat` files are located.

2. **Run Setup Script**:
   - Execute the `setup.bat` script by typing the following command and pressing Enter:
     ```
     setup.bat
     ```
   - This script will install necessary Node.js packages and set up the environment.

3. **Run Application**:
   - Execute the `run.bat` script by typing the following command and pressing Enter:
     ```
     run.bat
     ```
   - This will start the application.

#### For macOS Users

1. **Open Terminal**:
   - Navigate to the directory where the `.sh` files are located.

2. **Run Setup Script**:
   - Execute the `setup.sh` script with the following command:
     ```
     ./setup.sh
     ```
   - This script will check for Node.js, install it if it's missing, and manage other dependencies.

3. **Run Application**:
   - Execute the `run.sh` script with the following command:
     ```
     ./run.sh
     ```
   - This will launch the application.

### Additional Information
